# An interpreter for prof. Homenda's Pseudoassembler

---
What's working:
* MacOS, Windows and Linux support
* Syntax error detection and highlighting
* Keyboard shortcuts for file manipulation

To do:
* ~~Real number registers~~ (you will never use it)
* Spread awareness about registers being **very fast memory**

Known bugs:
* Keyboard shortcuts may not work on Windows machines
