# pseudoassembler-interpreter
An interpreter for prof. Homenda's Pseudoassembler

---
What's working:
* MacOS, Windows and Linux support
* Syntax error detection and highlighting
* Keyboard shortcuts for file manipulation

To do:
* Real number registers (not really)
* Spread awareness about registers being "very fast memory"

Known bugs:
* Shortcuts may not work on Windows machines
